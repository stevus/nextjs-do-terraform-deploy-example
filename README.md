# NextJS + Digital Ocean + Docker Deploy Example

**NOTE**: Still working on README contents etc but the code is really what matters. Adding this in as I go but wanted to share this as soon as I could.

Basics are:
- run the terraform apply
- add private secrets to github
- push branch to github

There might be some bugs in the impl since I haven't run this actual repo (in reality my setup is split between a Deploy repo and separate app repos) but I'll work those out, get the code updated, and get you more detailed instructions here.

Keep shipping!
